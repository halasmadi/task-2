            <h2>Pasta Alfredo</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        
          <li>8 ounces (about 225 grams) fettuccine pasta</li>
          <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>Optional garnish: Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <li>Cook the Fettuccine: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually around 8-10 minutes). Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
          <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the heavy cream. Stir constantly and allow the mixture to heat up, but don't let it come to a boil.</li>
          <li>Add Parmesan Cheese: Reduce the heat to low and gradually stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Continue to stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce thickens. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Be cautious with the salt, as the Parmesan cheese is already salty.</li>
          <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked fettuccine to the saucepan with the Alfredo sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce until it's well coated and heated through.</li>
          <li>Serve: Transfer the Fettuccine Alfredo to serving plates. Optionally, garnish with chopped fresh parsley for a pop of color and flavor.</li>
          <li>Enjoy: Serve the Fettuccine Alfredo hot and enjoy your creamy, cheesy pasta dish!</li>
